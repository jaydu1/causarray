# causarray

Advances in single-cell sequencing and CRISPR technologies have enabled detailed case-control comparisons and experimental perturbations at single-cell resolution. However, uncovering causal relationships in observational genomic data remains challenging due to selection bias and inadequate adjustment for unmeasured confounders, particularly in heterogeneous datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce `causarray` [Du26], a doubly robust causal inference framework for analyzing array-based genomic data at both bulk-cell and single-cell levels. `causarray` integrates a generalized confounder adjustment method to account for unmeasured confounders and employs semiparametric inference with ﬂexible machine learning techniques to ensure robust statistical estimation of treatment effects.


## Usage

We recommend using `causarray` in a conda environment:
```cmd
# create a new conda environment and install the necessary packages
conda create -n causarray python=3.12 -y

# activate the environment
conda activate causarray
```

The module can be installed via PyPI:
```cmd
pip install causarray
```

For optimal parallel performance, we recommend installing `llvm-openmp` if using conda:
```cmd
conda install -c conda-forge llvm-openmp
```

For `R` users, `reticulate` can be used to call `causarray` from R while
keeping NumPy >2 in the Python environment. Create the separate R environment
with a current NumPy-2-compatible reticulate build:

```bash
conda env create -f environment-r.yaml
```

The R tutorial runs from `causarray-r` and connects to the Python package in
the `causarray` environment.
The documentation and tutorials using both `Python` and `R` are available at [causarray.readthedocs.io](https://causarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Batch fitting API

For screens with hundreds to thousands of perturbations, use `gcate_lfc_batch` so
that peak memory is bounded by one batch at a time:

```python
from causarray import gcate_lfc_batch

df_res = gcate_lfc_batch(
    Y, X, A, r,
    batch_size=10,    # perturbations per batch (or use n_batches= for a fixed count)
    max_cells=2000,   # max pert cells per batch (ctrl added on top)
    n_ctrl=2000,      # fixed ctrl subsample shared across batches
    cache_path='results.h5',   # resume if interrupted
    verbose=True,
)
```

See the [Replogle-E-K562 tutorial](https://causarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/replogle/replogle-py.html)
for a demonstration on 200 perturbations from a genome-wide CRISPRi screen.

### Diagnostic masks without refitting effects

Treatment-by-gene support or quality-control rules can be aligned to an
existing causarray result table by label, even when its rows are reordered:

```python
from causarray import align_test_mask

keep = align_test_mask(
    df_res,
    support_mask,                 # treatments × genes, Boolean
    treatment_names=perturbations,
    gene_names=genes,
)
df_res_flagged = df_res.assign(support_keep=keep)
```

This operation only annotates or subsets existing results. It does not refit
the causarray LFC or change standard errors and p-values. If a diagnostic rule
was selected after inspecting the outcomes, retain the original adjusted
p-values rather than redefining the multiple-testing family post hoc. The
[Replogle tutorial](https://causarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/replogle/replogle-py.html)
compares several expression-support rules with marginal Wilcoxon results.
